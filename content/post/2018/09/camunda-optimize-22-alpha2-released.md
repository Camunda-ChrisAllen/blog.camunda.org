# Improve the UI/UX of the Reports/Dashboards/Alerts list

# Added night-time mode in Dashboard full screen mode

One of the key features that Optimize provides is the monitoring of the data. You create a dashboard with reports depicting all the important information at one glance. Therefore many users had a large screen in their office running Optimize with a dashboard on it. As soon as there occurred profound changes in their workflow they could immediately spot that on the dashboard.

However, during the night a bright screen can be really painful to look at after a while. To mitigate this problem, the new release of Optimize allows to toggle the theme in the fullscreen dashboard mode, such that everything becomes dark. That makes watching the Optimize dashboard even during the night time a pleasent experience. In the following you can see an example dark mode version of the dashboard:
