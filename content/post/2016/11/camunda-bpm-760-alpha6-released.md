# What's next?

We are getting closer to the 7.6.0 release which is scheduled for November 30, 2016. The last larger open topic is support for DMN DRDs (Decision Requirements Diagrams) in Modeling and Cockpit. Excution Support for DRDs has been added with 7.6.0-alpha2 and we are now working on bringing them into monitoring (Cockpit) and the Modeling tools (bpmn.io / Camunda Modeler).
