# Create BPMN process models in Confluence
You can **embed the BPMN macro on any page at any position**. This way, you can bring together diagrams and textual information, e.g. to enrich your process model by context information such as the corresponding process owner or referenced documents.

 You can **start modeling from scratch or import existing BPMN files**. All models are stored as attachments on the page at hand. If you edit a process model, a new version of the attachment is created.
 
When reading a Confluence page, **process models are rendered directly on the page**. The "viewer" also offers you a **fullscreen mode** which is handy for presentations or zooming into large models.

When you enter the **editing mode**, you have access to all the features bpmn.io provides you to make modeling your process models as comfortable as possible.

You can **export** your process models as **XML** and **SVG** files.

Permissions set on a page are inherited to the process diagrams, e.g. editing is only possible if you have the permissions to do so.
 
# Create DMN decision tables in Confluence

The same set of features is also available for DMN decision tables.
