We are happy to announce a new user forum for Camunda BPM. The new forum offers many advantages over our old forum:

* Improved search and sorting
* Better text formatting (markdown-like)
* Improved overall usability
* Much nicer look and feel
* User reputation system
* Independance from Google (You can use a google account but you don't have to)

Please check out the [new forum](https://forum.camunda.org/) and use it for new threads.

# What happens to the old user forum?
The content of the old forum will still be available. It will serve as a knowledge base which still can be accessed by everyone. You just can't create any new threads there.  

# What happens to existing threads?
You can finish existing discussions in the old forum. 

# What do I have to know about categories?
With the new forum we introduce categories. That allows a more focused way of addressing questions.
