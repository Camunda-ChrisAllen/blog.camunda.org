You probably have noticed, the design of this blog has recently changed.  
This is because we decided to have a design overhaul of our web apps and sites
and the most noticeable changes are happening in the tasklist.

Emphasis was set on reducing the visual hurdle, stripping down all unneeded / redondant elements like icons or background colors.

# Next steps

We spent quite some time discussing our choices and are pretty confident that this new design is a major improvement.
During those discussions, a lot of questions were raised and as the designers and developers we can only answer them by making assumptions.

 - Which of the _creation_, or _due_ date should be displayed first in the tasks list?
 - If you customized the tasklist, what did you changed?
 - How many task filters (in the left column) are displayed in your tasklist?
 - Are you using the task filters customizable colors?

Thanks to the [new forum](/post/2016/03/new-camunda-forum-discourse) you can answer
[those questions in a few clicks]() (of course, comments are also welcome).


# Accessibility

It is also worth mentionning that Sebastian Stamm put a lot of efforts improving the accessibility.   
You can now use the tasklist with leaving your hands from your keyboard.
Pressing the `tab` key to will get you anywhere in the tasklist and some keyboard shortcuts
were added as well.
