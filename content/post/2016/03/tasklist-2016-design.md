You probably have noticed, the design of this blog has recently changed.  
This is because we decided to have a design overhaul of our web apps and sites and the most noticeable changes
are happening in the tasklist.
<!--more-->
Emphasis was set on reducing the visual hurdle, stripping down all unneeded / redondant elements like icons or background colors.

We did spent quite some time discussing our choices and are pretty confident that this new design is a major improvement.
During those discussions, a lot of questions were raised and as the designers and developers we can only answer them by making assumptions.

And this is where you can help by telling us how you use the Camunda BPM tasklist.

 - Which of the creation, due or follow up date should be displayed first in the tasks list?
 - If you customize the tasklist, what did you changed?
 - How many filters are displayed at once?
 - Do you use the task filters customizable colors?

More generally, we would really like to hear about the experience of people who use this application.

Also worth mentionning, Sebastian Stamm put a lot of efforts improving the accessibility.   
You can now use the tasklist with leaving your hands from your keyboard.
Pressing the `tab` key to will get you anywhere in the tasklist and some keyboard shortcuts
were added as well.
