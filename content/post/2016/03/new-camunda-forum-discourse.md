We are happy to announce that the Camunda BPM Forum is moving to Discourse.
<!--more-->
The new URL of the Forum is https://forum.camunda.org and this is what it looks like:
<a href="https://forum.camunda.org">{{< figure class="teaser no-border" src="new-forum.png" alt="Join us in the new Forum" >}}</a>
We have announced the change last week on the now discontinued Google Group. Please read the post for a detailed explanations of our motives and [why we think Discourse is a better platform for our forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/camunda-bpm-users/W5aBtvtyCj0).
