## Features

* Compatibility with the new Camunda Modeler which uses the new <camunda> namespace

* Compatibility with the Camunda BPM Platform 7.4 which also supports the new <camunda> namespace

* Support for editing the event type "delete" for a task listener in the properties panel 

## Download and Update Sites

Please refer to our documentation for information on the [Eclipse Update Sites](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.4/modeler/eclipse-plugin/update-sites/).

Note that the URLs of the update sites changed. 

## Breaking Change

This major version contains a breaking change, since we introduced the new <camunda> namespace for the extension elements and attributes. 

The Camunda Eclipse Plugin version 3.0 ist compatible with Camunda BPM versions 7.4.0, 7.3.3, 7.2.6 onwards. 

## The Future of Modelling

We strongly advise you to consider our new Camunda Modeler in the long run, since it offers a much better usability and also supports DMN.
