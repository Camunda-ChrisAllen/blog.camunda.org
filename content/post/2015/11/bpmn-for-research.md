+++

We have put together a collection of BPMN 2.0 diagrams for research purposes. These diagrams have been created in our [BPMN trainings](http://camunda.com/bpmn/training/), which we have been giving since 2008. In all of these trainings, the participants created BPMN diagrams based on so called text-to-model exercises. We provide you with the exercise texts, the participants' results as well as our sample solutions.

All diagrams have been anonymized and are provided as BPMN 2.0 XML files, which can be downloaded from our [BPMN for Research repository](https://github.com/camunda/bpmn-for-research) on GitHub. 

The following diagram illustrates the process in which these diagams have been created.

There are German and English diagrams, which are sorted into folders of four separate exercises.

## Feedback Welcome!

For research purposes the diagrams are freely available. We are excited to hear about your results. Please do let us know!
