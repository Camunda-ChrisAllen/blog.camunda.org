I was already asked a couple of times by customers where they should start reading about DMN and how to execute decision with [Camunda BPM 7.4](http://blog.camunda.org/post/2015/11/camunda-bpm-740-released/). Great that so many people want to start right away! So let's make it easy, here are my personal favorites for now:

## Thanks!

At this place I wanted to say a very big thank you to the product team. I think I was an annoying colleague over the last weeks asking so much questions as I got my first examples/showcases working (I did my first sales pitch with live demo already with a SNAPSHOT version of pre-alpha2 ;-)) and developed our super, brand new 

[DMN Training](http://camunda.com/dmn/training/) (CU there?)!

Thank you guys - now let's enjoy DMN!
