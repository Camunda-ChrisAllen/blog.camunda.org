I was already asked a couple of times by customers where they should start reading about DMN and how to execute decision with [Camunda BPM 7.4](http://blog.camunda.org/post/2015/11/camunda-bpm-740-released/). Great that so many people want to start right away! So let's make it easy, here are my personal favorties for now:

## Interesting Links

* [DMN Tutorial](https://camunda.org/dmn/tutorial/): To get an overview of DMN and Decision Tables.

* [DMN Plain Java Example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/tree/master/dmn-engine/dmn-engine-java-main-method): To see how easy you can evaluate decisions without any infrastructure, container or database.

* [Invoice Example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tree/master/examples/invoice): Small process application containing a BPMN process calling a DMN decision table.

* [DMN Reference](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/reference/dmn11/): The full reference what Camunda can do with DMN in 7.4.

* [DMN Engine Docs](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/dmn-engine/): The User Guide about the DMN Engine.

* [Using DMN within BPMN](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/decisions/): User Guide about how to use DMN within the BPMN Process Engine and e.g. do data mapping in between.

We are still working on a dedicated Get Started Guide - so stay tuned.

## Thanks!

At this place I wanted to say a very big thank you to our two Sebastians - Sebastian Stamm who developed the DMN Modeler and Sebastian Menski who developed the core DMN engine. I think I was an annoying colleague over the last weeks asking so much questions as I got my first examples/showcases working (I did my first sales pitch with live demo already with a SNAPSHOT version of pre-alpha2 ;-)) and developed our formidable brand new 

[DMN Training](http://camunda.com/dmn/training/) (CU there?)!

Thank you guys - now let's enjoy DMN!
