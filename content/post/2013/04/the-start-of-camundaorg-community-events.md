Last week we had our first two camunda.org community kick-off events. On Wednesday we were at the Deutsche WertpapierService Bank AG in Frankfurt followed by an evening on Thursday at LVM Versicherung in MÃ¼nster.<br />
Both companies successfully work with camunda BPM and have spoken of their experiences with the platform.<br />
We also got a chance to present the camunda project to groups of about 20 BPM enthusiasts and had open discussions about aims, preferences, likes and wishes.<br />
A lot of positive feedback trickled through this week and more evenings with varying subjects will follow.<br />

And last but not least, our partners <a href="http://plexiti.com/" target="_blank">Plexiti</a> just introduced camunda BPM at the JUG Barcelona. Thanks to Rafael Cordones for flying the camunda flag in Spain.<br />
