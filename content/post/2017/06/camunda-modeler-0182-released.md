We are happy to announce the Camunda Modeler version 1.8.2 release!

This patch release contains a bug fix where changing process properties using the properties panel led to inconsistencies and made modeling the diagram impossible.

We recommend all users of version 1.8.1 to [download](https://camunda.org/bpmn/tool/) the new version from [camunda.org](https://camunda.org/bpmn/tool/) as soon as possible.


## What's next?

In our current milestone we will focus on reworking text annotations and further improving the usability of the Camunda Modeler.
