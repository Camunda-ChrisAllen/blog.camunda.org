# Camunda BPM Team Blog

Generated by [Hugo][hugo] and styled with some fancy [node.js][nodejs] tools like [Grunt][grunt], [less][less].

## Writing a Post

The blog is generated using a static site generator ([Hugo][hugo]). This means that the blog has no "backend", no database, no php, no nothing. It is simply a list of html files that are uploaded to our webserver. Just like in the old days.

In order to write a new post, simply create a pull request containing a new markdown file inside the [post folder](https://github.com/camunda/blog.camunda.org/tree/master/content/post).
Posts are organized by year and date so make sure to put your file into the correct folder.

We will merge the pull request which will trigger re-publishing of the blog.
